ICL8038 Triangle to Sine Converter
==================================

I was looking at an applicaiton note for the old ICL8038 function generator
IC, and came across the internal schematic of the chip. There is a triangle
to sine converter at the end that looked interesting, so I assembled it
in the Falstad simulator to explore its operation. I'm publishing the
simulation data for anyone who wants to play with it, and including the
datasheet and app note here for convenience (obviously those documents are
not mine).

To run it, go to the URL below, pick Import from Text from the menu, and
paste in the contents of the falstad.txt file.
